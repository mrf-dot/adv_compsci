Recursion:

func fib(n)
	if (n <= 1)
		return n
	return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

Examples of iteration:
	for loop
	while loop
	goto statement

Extra variables needed for an iterative func fib:
int prev;
int curr;

Iterative fib function:

func fib(n)
	prev = 0
	curr = 1
	sum = 0
	for i in range(1, n)
		sum = prev + curr
		prev = curr
		curr = sum

-	The choice of whether to use a recursive
	or iterative function is dependent on
	computing efficiency vs. programming efficiency

-	Iterative functions take more time to write but
	recursive functions are more computationally expensive
