Objectives

    Create your own ArrayList
    Implement an interface
    Re-size an array when necessary
    Use generic types with < >

Questions to consider before you start

    What is an interface? What does it do?
    If a class implements an interface, what does that mean? What has to happen?
    If you are using a [ ] array in a program and need to add an element, but the array is full, what could you do?
    What are some things you can do with an ArrayList?
    In an ArrayList declaration, what does or do?

Questions to consider after you finish

    To make a program that has a re-sizing array, we don't HAVE to implement an interface, so why do we implement interfaces? What is the benefit?
    Would our re-sizing array algorithm be a good one for really big data sets? Why or why not?
